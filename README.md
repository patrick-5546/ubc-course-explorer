# UBC Path Explorer

Simple web application built with Django. The application aims to provide an one-stop interface for UBC students to find course information, including professor ratings, grade distribution, and nested prerequisite courses, in hopes of helping them better plan out their study path throughout university.

The data was collected from [UBCGrades](https://ubcgrades.com/), [UBC Course Explorer](https://ubcexplorer.io/), and [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=1413). **RateMyProf local data was last updated January 9th, 2021. The most recent term available from UBCGrades is 2020S for grades, and 2018S for section professors.**

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/patrick-5546/ubc-course-explorer/wiki) for screenshots of the website, updating the RateMyProf data, as well as useful information for developers who want to build on this application.

UBC Course Planner is the result of revising and completing the [Oakhacks 2020 first place project](https://github.com/ad2969/university-path-explorer).
